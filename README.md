## Logistics
You are given 170 minutes to complete the exam. It consists of around 65 questions.


## Types and characteristics of exam questions

There are two types of questions on the exam:

- Multiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors).
- Multiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more options. These types of questions will explicitly tell you to "(Select TWO)" or "(Select THREE)."

## Use these strategies when answering questions:

- Read and understand the question before reading answer options (pretend the answer options aren't even there at first).
- Identify the key phrases and qualifiers in the question.
- Try to answer the question before even looking at the answer choices, then see if any of those answer choices match your original answer.
- Eliminate answer options based on what you know about the question, including the key phrases and qualifiers you highlighted earlier.
- If you still don't know the answer, consider flagging the question and moving on to easier questions. But remember to answer all questions before the time is up on the exam, as there are no penalties for guessing.
