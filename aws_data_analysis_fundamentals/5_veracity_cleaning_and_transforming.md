# Veracity â€“ cleansing and transformation

- When you have data that is ungoverned, coming from numerous, dissimilar systems and cannot curate the data in meaningful ways, you know you have a veracity problem.
- **Curation** is the action or process of selecting, organizing, and looking after the items in a collection.
- **Data integrity** is the maintenance and assurance of the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle.
- **Data veracity** is the degree to which data is accurate, precise, and trusted.
- Data veracity is contingent on the integrity of the data. We will discuss the specifics of data integrity in the next topic.

- not all data is generated equally
- data integrity
  - creation: ensuring data accuracy when data is created, regular audits might be necessary
  - aggregation: key phase for many systems, loss of integrity in this phase might due to planning
  - storage: maintaining data in secure form, some data is subject to frequent change, and some are stable
  - access: your data is visible to users, data's integrity cannot change, here it is mostly read only
  - sharing: once report has been created they are shared with businesses, read only here too.

**Data cleansing** is the process of detecting and correcting corruptions within data.
**Referential integrity** is the process of ensuring that the constraints of table relationships are enforced.
**Domain integrity** is the process of ensuring that the data being entered into a field matches the data type defined for that field..
**Entity integrity** is the process of ensuring that the values stored within a field match the constraints defined for that field.
