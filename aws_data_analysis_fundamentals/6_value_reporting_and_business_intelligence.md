# Value - reporting and business intelligence

- When you have massive volumes of data used to support a few golden insights, you may be missing the value of your data.
- Information analytics is the process of analyzing information to find the value contained within it. This term is often synonymous with data analytics.


## five types of analysis
### descriptive
- often called data mining
- this form is the oldest and most common. This method involves aggregating or comparing historic values to answer the question “What happened?” or “What is happening?”
- provides insights and requires a large amount of human judgment to turn those insights into actionable information.

### diagnostic
- involves comparing historic data, often gathered in descriptive analysis, to other data sets to answer the question “Why did it happen?”
- 

### predictive
- involves predicting what might happen in the future based on what happened in the past.
- this form of analysis provides insights called predictions. These predictions also require human judgment to evaluate the validity, ensuring they are realistic.

### prescriptive
- involves looking at historic data and predictions to answer the question “What should be done?”
- this form of analysis deviates from the three previous in that it requires applications to incorporate rules and constraints to make intelligent recommendations
- greatest advantage of this form of analysis is that it can be automated
- Machine learning makes this method of analysis possible. 


### cognitive
- This form of analysis uses a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning.
- Deep learning, along with prescriptive analysis, is used to make decisions and take action based upon visual, auditory, or even natural language inputs.
- With each analysis, the results feed back into a knowledge database to inform future decisions.
- Self learning feedback loop
