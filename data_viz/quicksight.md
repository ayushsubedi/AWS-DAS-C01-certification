# QuickSight

- Fast, easy, cloud-powered business analytics service (which is a little different compared to other AWS offerings)
- different because it is not primarily targeted towards engineers and it can also be considered to be a separate product.  
- lets you create and publish interactive BI dashboards
- can be accessed and embedded into apps, websites etc
- first BI service to offer pay per session pricing, only pay when your users access their dashboards or reports, making it cost effective for large scale deployments
- Amazon QuickSignt Q: ask questions of your data and receive answers
- SPICE:
